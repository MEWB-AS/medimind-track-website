    },
    "medimind": {
      "headline": "Why MediMind exists",
      "paragraph1": "Most healthcare software is built by people who have never worked a shift in a hospital. The result is systems that look good in demos but create friction in practice. Workflows that make sense on a whiteboard but fall apart at 3 AM when a nurse needs to find an IV pump.",
      "paragraph2": "MediMind started differently. Our founders spent years working in clinical environments, observing the gap between how healthcare systems actually function and how technology vendors assume they work. We saw the workarounds. The frustration. The wasted time.",
      "paragraph3": "So we built a company around a simple principle: involve clinicians from the start — not as focus group participants, but as partners, advisors, and co-builders. Every product decision is informed by people who understand the reality of patient care."
    },
    "sense": {
      "headline": "Introducing MediMind Sense",
      "paragraph1": "MediMind Sense is our real-time asset visibility platform. It helps clinical and operations teams know where mobile medical equipment is, how it's being used, and whether they have the right amount.",
      "paragraph2": "The idea came directly from hospital floors. We watched staff spend significant portions of their shifts searching for wheelchairs, IV pumps, and portable monitors. We saw departments hoarding equipment out of fear they wouldn't find it when needed. We documented the workarounds, the radio calls, the frustration.",
      "paragraph3": "Sense was designed to solve this without adding burden. Battery-free tags that require no maintenance. Minimal infrastructure that deploys in weeks. A simple interface that works the way clinicians think — not the way IT systems are typically organized."
    },
    "clinicians": {
      "headline": "Built with clinicians, not just for them",
      "paragraph1": "Thirteen practicing doctors serve as advisors, seed investors, and active contributors to MediMind. They aren't names on a website. They participate in product reviews, challenge our assumptions, and ensure we stay grounded in clinical reality.",
      "paragraph2": "These physicians represent different specialties — from emergency medicine to surgery to internal medicine. They work in different hospital systems across different countries. This diversity means we hear multiple perspectives on every decision we make.",
      "paragraph3": "When we debate a feature, a doctor is in the room. When we design a workflow, we test it with people who will actually use it. This isn't a marketing message — it's how we work."
